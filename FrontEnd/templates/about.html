           In the Dec 2017 iteration of BOTTER THAN YOU, an application developed by London Lowmanstone and William Yao,
           a computer bot plays Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4 at a professional level. Utilizing the premises of Monte Carlo
           and Minimax Algorithms with optimizations, the bot learns to play games on the fly, and play them very well. 
           Just be warned, you will lose much more that you will win.
